5,1,"i will start by saying we have a nice new deck .  that is where the good part ends .  n nwhy two stars if we have a nice deck now ?  well ,  it all started in may when we had a man named al come out and talk to us about the process .  he was a true salesman ,  i ll tell you that .  not a straight shooter ,  but an excited salesman that wanted to sell .  .  .  and we bought into it .  n nhe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs ,  but they could probably start by june   th .  mind you ,  this was the end of may we met with him .  he said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from dormont before they started .  we felt confident in going with them ,  and booked it .  n nhere s where things fell apart .  weeks went by with no word from them on the process .  finally i called and left messages .  al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing .  he must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles .  so i hung up not knowing what was going on .  finally i called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back .  i wish al would have told us that .  n nso our june   th date came and went .  we finally got our survey .  and they were quick to bill us for it ,  but no word on where we were in the process .  i called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin .  apparently they were now waiting for the permit from dormont .  n na month later ,  i was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company .  i spoke with someone who told me that dormont usually takes a week to process the permit ,  but we were now going on a month .  he told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it .   n ni completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault ,  but why no communication about it ?  just call me and tell me they re waiting for the permit ,  but they ll work towards asking dormont what the hold up is .  seems simple .  n nfinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start .  tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from dormont on holes they re digging .  so holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days .  where did everyone go ?  who knows ,  because i wasn t informed !   n ni was upset and contacted the company owner ,  dave ,  by email .  i told him how frustrated i was about the lack of communication .  he wrote me two sentences that  said   there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow .    well ,  that didn t happen .  n nthen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left .  the main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong .  so apparently the part about how they wouldn t need access to my house changes to they re drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck .   n nfinally ,  the second week into construction ,  my tiny   x   foot deck is done .  it was upsetting that they left the deck dirty ,  and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn t cleaned up .  i even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn t use ,  and they only filled up one .  when you create a construction project ,  isn t it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice ?  didn t happen here .  n nmy main point is ,  contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy .  why be that company ?  why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust ?  my main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front ,  nor was the ongoing process communicated to me .  then they left everything unfinished in my eyes ,  leaving the site dirty .  i understand things happen and things get delayed ,  but just email or call me .  it s not that hard to keep me updated ,  it is      with a million ways to be contacted .  n neven though i have a nice deck  after i clean things up myself !   ,  i would not recommend them to anyone .

35,1,"i have to say that i write this review with much regret ,  because i have always loved papa j s .  but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .   n nfrom the minute we were seated ,  we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn t know the menu .  as i said before ,  i ve been to papa j s a good handful of times so i know the menu decently well ,  but the server couldn t explain any of the questions i had about a couple new dishes i was thinking about trying .  i swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago .  n nbut it wasn t just the knowledge of the menu .  it was one thing after another with our server .  my wife asked for a glass of water   times until she finally got it  at which point the meal was over ,  so we didn t care at that point  .   i mean come on ,  for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water ?  there was no one filling up water .  n nmy biggest complaint ,  however ,  is what happened with our meals .  my dad and i both ordered the trout special  trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat  .  instead ,  the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms .  not what the special was at all .   and by the way ,  that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server  which ,  we are sure it was  or the chef ,  who knows for certain .  not to mention ,  though ,  that a good server wouldn t have served us that regardless .   n nbut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server ,  let me continue .  when we informed our server of the mistake ,  he didn t really believe us until he checked his order sheet ,  and then he blamed the error on the chef .  at this point ,  the meal had been sitting  because it took us forever to flag this guy down again  so the trout was basically cold .  the server then said he would have the meals re made .  so ,  he took the meals back to the kitchen .  meanwhile ,  of course ,  my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and i are sitting there with no meals .  also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for ,  and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda  yes ,  believe that or not  .  all the kitchen did was scrape their   mistake   off of our fish !  they didn t remake anything .  our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it .  quite frankly ,  the fish wasn t good at all .  i honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from mcdonald s that night .  the server never did anything to try to make our experience better   he knew we weren t happy ,  but never offered anything such as dessert on the house .  i m not looking for a handout ,  but our experience was just plain awful that night .  the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .  normally ,  i may have asked for a manager ,  but at this point i was ready to just get out of there  plus ,  we had to be somewhere else that night  .  n nmy opinion .  .  .  for the money ,  there are many other restaurants i would rather eat at .

43,1,"the worst dental experience of my life .   they are butchers !   my husband and i went to emmert dental in bethel park for a routine cleaning and check up .   i had one tooth that i had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled .   after the so called dentist   dr carnavali   did my exam ,  i needed   additional root canals and an extraction !  an extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal .  i was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible .   i didn t know any better ,  so i agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later .  the   dentist   wanted to extract it that day ,  but i had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain .  so ,    weeks later ,  i went in for the extraction .   after they gave me novocaine they get me with   you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth   .  i have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so i didn t feel it was necessary .  i had   employees surrounding me ,  pressuring me for this bone graft .  so ,  i reluctantly agreed .  i had to pay      .    for this   bone graft   .  so ,  i signed everything .  i wasn t even given enough time to read the document ,  so i should have known and got up and left right then and there .  the   dentist   started the extraction .  i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .  he pulled on my tooth ,  used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest .   finally ,  after a good    minutes of this torture ,  he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw .  i was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat .  he then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area .  i m assuming this was the bone graft .   i ended up with many stitches .  i was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following saturday so they could start the bridge .  then i was hit with a bill of      .    !  my insurance covers      of extractions .   i was in so much pain for   weeks following the extraction .  pain severe enough that i had to call off work and i couldn t sleep at night .   i refused to go back to emmert dental .   and after a visit to a very reputable dentist ,  an endodontist and an oral surgeon ,  i have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage emmert dental has done to my mouth .   they caused a very large deformity in my jaw and i am at risk to lose additional teeth .   save yourself a lot of time ,  money and pain .   emmert dental only cares about the money ,  will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work .   they are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist .  and if you have an issue with their billing practices ,  don t expect to that resolved easily .   i have called numerous times and i am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in .   i have contacted the bbb and a lawyer .   i expect and want a full refund .   no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .   they do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant .   now i have to go thru oral surgery ,  more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of emmert dental .   and the root canals they said i needed ,  my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that i do not need tooth canals .   in fact ,  the teeth are perfectly healthy .   they are crooks and butchers .

70,2,"i ve stayed at a couple of extended stay sites that i found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good .  excellent place to stay while visiting pittsburgh .  it is just a five minute drive to downtown .  location is in a business park area so it is quiet .   n nthe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator ,  sink ,  cabinets and two burners .  there is no oven which i expected as the descriptions all state   full kitchen   so be aware of that .  also they do not keep the dishes ,  pots and pans ,  coffee makers ,  toasters or utensils in the rooms .  if you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in .   n nthe room was clean and well maintained .  cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable .  the free wifi is usually fast .   n nthe best part about this location was the staff .  the people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile .   i would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it .
